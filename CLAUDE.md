- **Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Structure**: Shared components + individual website projects

---

## 📅 Development Timeline

### **Session 1 - Initial Setup & Design (July 14, 2025)**

#### **🚀 Major Accomplishments**
1. **Fixed Blank Page Issue**
   - Problem: Empty `my-sites/package.json` causing startup failures
   - Solution: Added complete package.json with React/TypeScript/Vite dependencies
   - Moved `index.html` from `public/` to root for proper Vite entry point

2. **Implemented Single-Page Scrolling Website**
   - Analyzed Columbus1919.com for design inspiration
   - Built modern scrolling sections: Hero, About, Services, Contact
   - Added Tailwind CSS v4 with custom color scheme and typography
   - Created responsive navigation with smooth scroll and active section highlighting

3. **Repository Restructuring**
   - Renamed `my-sites/` to `upskiller/` for better naming
   - Created `shared/` directory structure for reusable components
   - Enhanced SharedButton component with variants (primary, secondary, accent)
   - Removed tool-01 references and cleaned up unused files

4. **Development Environment Optimization**
   - Added comprehensive `.gitignore` for React/TypeScript projects
   - Removed build artifacts (`dist/`, compiled `.js` files) from version control
   - Configured Vite port to 5175 for consistency
   - Cleaned up duplicate and compiled files

5. **Documentation & Onboarding**
   - Created comprehensive README.md for new developers
   - Step-by-step setup instructions from zero to running project
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Learning resources and contributing guidelines
   - Project structure showing planned multi-website architecture

#### **🛠️ Technical Decisions**

**Framework Choices:**
- **React 18** for component architecture
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling

**Project Structure:**
```
00_Websites/
├── shared/                 # Reusable components across projects
├── upskiller/             # Main company website
├── tool-website-01/       # Planned: First tool website
└── [future-websites]/     # Additional websites
```

**Design System:**
- Primary colors: Blue (#0ea5e9)
- Accent color: Green (#10b981)
- Typography: Inter (body), Poppins (headings)
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind utilities

#### **🔧 Commands for New Team Members**
```bash
# Setup
git clone https://github.com/upskiller-xyz/00_Websites.git
cd 00_Websites/upskiller
npm install

# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server (localhost:5175)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run lint         # Check code quality

# Quality Checks Before Committing
npm run lint && npm run build
```

#### **📋 Current Status**
- ✅ Upskiller website: Complete single-page design with scrolling sections
- ✅ Shared components: Basic structure established
- ✅ Development workflow: Documented and tested
- ⏳ Tool websites: Planned but not yet implemented

#### **🎯 Next Steps / Future Tasks**
1. Create `tool-website-01/` directory and basic structure
2. Add more shared components (Layout, Header, Footer)
3. Implement form validation for contact forms
4. Add animations and micro-interactions
5. Set up deployment pipeline (Netlify/Vercel)
6. Add testing framework (Vitest/Jest)

#### **🚨 Important Notes for Future Sessions**
- Vite dev server runs on port 5175 (configured in vite.config.ts)
- All imports from shared components use `../../shared/` path structure
- Build artifacts are gitignored - never commit dist/ or compiled .js files
- Follow conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
